# Architect

Core system protocol for the Game of Life Minecraft server, designed to connect together all the various server plugins and systems.

While this is a standalone plugin, it should not be used by anyone other than us, as it is specifically made just for Game of Life.

Architect is licensed under the Unlicense license. That means you can do anything you want with this code. Enjoy!

To build this project, just run `./gradlew build`, and the output jar will be located in `build/libs`.
